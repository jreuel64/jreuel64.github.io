		<p id="about">

			<span id="about_p1" class="translatable">My name is James Long and I am a computer science major at the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul Minnesota and will be graduating May 2019. I was born and raised in Rochester Minnesota, and graduated from Byron High School in 2016.  I loved sports growing up and played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. My senior year of high school I was captain of the football and baseball team as well as academic all-state in baseball.  I continued on to play football in college for a year at St. Thomas, but gave it up in order to focus on school. </span><br/></br/>


			<span id="about_p2" class="translatable">After graduating from college I will be working at IBM in Rochester. I will be working on both the security and storage class memory teams for the PowerVM Hypervisor. As of now, I plan on eventually returning to college for a masters in either information security or software engineering.  </span><br/><br/><br/>
